      /*stopPropagation():
      The stopPropagation() method is used to prevent an event from propagating further up the DOM tree. When called on an event object, 
      it stops the event from reaching any parent elements.*/
    });

    middleDiv.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
      console.log('Middle div clicked');

<!--In this example:

Three nested <div> elements are created with IDs inner, middle, and outer.
Event listeners are attached to each div to log a message when they are clicked.
The event listener on the innerDiv includes a call to stopPropagation().
When you click on the innerDiv, the following will happen:

The click event will first be handled by the innerDiv's event listener.
Inside the innerDiv's event handler, stopPropagation() is called, which prevents the event from bubbling up to the middleDiv and 
outerDiv.
As a result, only the message "Inner div clicked" will be logged to the console.
If you remove the stopPropagation() call from the innerDiv's event handler, the event will bubble up to the middleDiv and outerDiv, 
and the messages "Inner div clicked", "Middle div clicked", and "Outer div clicked" will all be logged to the console.
